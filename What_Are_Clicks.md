# Audio clicks: what they are and how to recognize them

This document is intentionally non-technical.  
It is written for players who want to recognize and record the specific audio clicks we are interested in.

## 1) What we mean by “clicks”

While using the **FSS** in *Elite Dangerous*, some players have noticed a very short, repetitive **clicking sound** that is clearly distinct from normal FSS ambience.

- The clicks are brief, percussive, and rhythmic  
- They repeat with a stable pattern  
- They are not tied to scanning or locking onto a body  

If you want to inspect them visually, you can record your audio (for example with Audacity) and look at the **spectrogram**.  
The clicks appear as sharp, vertical lines.

This is the kind of signal we are trying to collect.

## 2) How players have been able to trigger those clicks

There is no guaranteed method, but the following steps have worked repeatedly for some players.

**Suggested procedure:**

- Jump into a new system.
- On arrival, **do not move your ship**.
- Perform a basic system honk.
- Switch to **FSS mode**.
- Do **not** scan or lock onto any bodies.
- Slowly move the FSS cursor around the sky, preferably away from obvious stars and planets.

At this point:

- You may hear the clicks immediately.
- Or you may need to keep the cursor moving for a short while before they appear.
- In some cases, the clicks may not appear at all.

## 3) Things that seem to prevent the clicks

Based on current observations, the clicks are unlikely to appear if:

- The system is already fully discovered (for example if the honk reveals everything).
- You moved the ship before entering FSS mode.
- You actively scan bodies in FSS instead of just moving the cursor.

These are observations, not confirmed rules.

## 4) Important note

This project does **not** assume:

- That the clicks encode a message.
- That they are directional.
- That they are tied to a specific object.

We are simply collecting consistent recordings of the same audio phenomenon, along with precise system metadata, so it can later be analyzed more rigorously.
